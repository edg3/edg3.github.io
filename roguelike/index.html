        <h1>Become A Rogue</h1>
        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        "Become A Rogue" is how I felt I needed to create a playable game project, it is mostly to test if I can be a programmer after a brain injury. Essentially to keep myself interested in the project I felt I need to add different features.<br /><br />
        In "Become A Rogue" we have the normal roguelike play that you can use, however we are adding several things to this roguelike. You spend your time hunting evil monsters, getting loot (including gear and food), and making an attempt to reach several "end game" bos monsters in the game. It will also have several changes to the project to add start (and weird of funny) things. I wan this game to have more that you can do BESIDES the roguelike dungeon side of the game.<br /><br />

        <h2>The List of Potential Additions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Working out a "sleep/rest" system to heal (and you can only spend 75% of the day without sleeping? we get tired)</li>
            <li>Weather? (cold days, hot days, summer, winter?)</li>
            <li>Not yet likely (still) but ablutions?</li>
            <li>NPCs turning to enemies when you attack them?</li>
            <li>Brewing potions (with a way to achieve a "brewing level" on your brew, best effect, most time, etc)</li>
            <li>I am sharing on the Make Games SA Facebook group and there are some discussions there, however at the time of posting this there will be a direct copy on the Make Games SA Forums</li>

        <h2>Playtest Version:</h2>
        Version: <b>0.1</b><br /><br />
        Minor Version 1.<br /><br />
        All that was needed for this starting project was a "playable roguelike".<br /><br />
        <a href="download link here edg3">Not yet available.</a>
        <h2>Platform and Library</h2>
        This is built using Visual Studio 2015 for XNA as such it runs on 32-bit Windows currently.<br /><br />
        Depending on how this ends up going (especially since I want to be able to use this on my phone) it will swap to a completely different library (potentially MonoGame) and as many of the platforms as I can pull off.<br /><br />
