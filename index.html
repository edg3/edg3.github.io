        <h2>An Explanation of Me</h2>
        Welcome back to "loveland.co.za" and thank you! The owner (me) is Ernest Loveland. I have been a programmer, game developer and student for many years. I am currently attempting to get my life back on track because of breaking changes that occured.<br /><br />
        I have had thoughts for changes to this "blog" and can share that I hope this is the final form that I make it be.<br /><br />
        Firstly I may blog multiple times in a day, once a day, once a week or not post for a few weeks. For my recovery posting is what I need to attempt to do.<br /><br />        
        <h2>Latest Content</h2>
