        <h1>Week 1: Getting Things Going</h1><br />
        
        <h2>What I will do here.</h2>
        So I can summerise what I am doing in a thoughtful way. I am going to share how the week went, what I did, the frustrating parts and especially what I actually learned!<br />
        <br />
        This does add some complexity to all of what I share but don't worry - we will get through this. I promise.<br />
        
        <h2>How the week went</h2><br/>
        The week went along as expected - I am expected to go through a job (internship) test to see what possibilities will be for my future (close to the end of Feb). That gets me through the tender need I have for my feelings to be helped. I spent hours regularly programming and doing math and when I finished one project got bored trying to attempt something new. This working takes that away since I always have something to do. There has been tiny annoyance compared to that added to me, but we will go through what I can show off and PROVE that where I was found incorrect (so many times) is actually the literal truth and I will share them regularly like this so that other people that need this knowledge can recheck and relearn things.<br />
        <br />
        That being the summary I can get going into what I want to do for this. For sharing this link with anyone use the link on the right side - it's easier to be correct always.<br />

        <h2>What I got up to.</h2>
        I learned a lot about people's "teaching" you by giving problems you have to solve. I eventually had to speak to the important staff member about it and he said he will give me the list of what I need to do for it to be "complete". Why is this shared you may ask... Well it is shared in an easy way for you to completely understand it: for this finish a program that makes random numbers. I finished that on the first day apart from showing the result (hence I chose it wasn't a complete answer) - you need to COMPLETE that in an hour. Since that isn't technically complete (since it needs to be shown in the console) I did it the second day. <br /><br />
        Second day I did exactly what I did on the Monday: it was showing correctly. The summary of the check? No Ernest, you need to name your variables in a different fashion. Since it took ages (average was 45 minutes to get my code checked, fastest was half an hour this week) it was past the hour. Enter the next day.<br /><br />
        Wednesday I did the same thing but with the random name changes to make long names. Since I can't use a variable "x" or "y" as it had to be "x_that_is_used_to_calculate" and a long name for "y" to share this as an example. The resulting answer was what I found horrendous because of doing programming work for <big>6 companies</big> I worked for in the past was told to me that the companies don't ever do that hence I must name my variables this way. Cool. Clearly my working experience is not correct. Then was told with that renaming was correct BUT I don't use brackets "{ }" after an "if" statement. Ernest you HAVE TO HAVE THAT EVERY IF STATEMENT. Clear example can be given:<br />
        if (somecondition == met) return someanswer;<br/>
        Cancels code, takes need for changes away, is the ONLY way that it can go EVER for this to be a correct answer. Nope. Wrap it in brackets. Cool. I was told I also need to stop a flicker (caused by the bad hardware of my laptop being old compared to the other laptops he clearly uses) where when you clear the console and write a string to it you see a black flick, I also was told that it needs to be made as big as I need it, that my code doesn't follow all the standards. Your personal standards are NOT correct standards. After that I thankfully got some peace. I didn't do the code since I thought with those changes made I would be told I did it wrong by spending more than an hour.<br /><br />
        Enter Friday. I was hopeful I could end this - I don't ever want my correct answers that for COMPANIES are 150% correct to be kciked under the bus again. Before I share what happened on the friday I can summerise it easily: Ernest you are bad at programming and clearly can't have this project correct at all. I will share the peices of code a LOT later in this post, don't worry.<br /><br />
        So let us get through the actual Friday entry: I did the hour long code at home (since I had a delay to leave to work at 9:20AM, started at 8:17AM with the challenge completed it by 9:00AM but then spent 16 minutes adding a change since I was annoyed at how simple it was to be "Complete"). What I can say about starting at 8:17AM is "Don't rely on installing software (the first Visual Studio 2017 install on my personal computer) letting you start immediately." - I didn't want the delay but it was there because of getting my setup ready. So I finished it - emailed the code for using these times in my proof - then got to go to work. Awesome - doing all the annoying (annoying because the companies I worked for faught people that did these things) things so I can get rid of this need. Got to work, had to watch a presentation, the guy was watching aswell, the presentation ended, I unpacked my equipment (I arrived right at the start of the presentation), look up - nope not there. He came back in the afternoon - doing whatever since he told lots of differences he needed to do<br /><br />
        I did cheat after lunch by checking the other answers given by interns. They got an incorrect answer but with their code being the same since they "finished" I had to change my result to be at their level - especially since I wanted to kick it out. When he got to checking it (hours after lunch) "no that is the incorrect answer" after I told him I found the answer was incorrect but I made changes because of what was found correct for the other interns (not that I'm an intern yet, not that I will share who they are). He fought with me some more - what HE SHOULD LEARN is <big>DONT MAKE CHANGES TO OTHER PEOPLES CODE AND MAKE WHAT YOU DO BE INCORRECT AND THEN BLAME THEM</big>. It took me hours upon hours to fix all of his changes making my code incorrect. For the interns change it was only changing "random.Next(3);" to "0;" in the code I wrote. Never minding all the code I got to write being 3 times as much code for his long naming treatment - I was told I clearly write to much code. I did it EXACTLY like I was told (forced) to. I was doing the correct answer and can show that off which I will do in it's category: my code (long because I did the game developer treatment to making it and it was forced to need long variable names and brackets, etc) completely filled what it needed. I got told tons of differences I need to do since "NOT HAVING THESE DIFFERENCES IN YOUR CODE MAKES YOUR CODE WRONG" - my answer? Then why tell people "do A, B and then C" and when you check it does have that yet you fight them and say "you have A, B and C but you should add D, E, F, G, ..." yeah. That is my summery of why he is not a good person.<br /><br />
        You can read below what I titled "Code Challenge" to show what you are asked to do, what it needs, my code and what simplifies how I treat this: proof what I said tons of times.<br /><br />
        The other activities are easier to summarise in a good way: I got given tiny challenges to program and on average finished them in an hour. Especially because that was needed. I was told "the average time is good - a day or two" except when it takes me a tiny amount of time the changes that are strange make checking it take so long and add so much annoyance.<br /><br />
        I also had to learn Angular JS - that went well, technically I could do it mostly after the first day or learning. What I haven't yet shared is I learn coding very fast - I just take long to say I am complete so I can make careful checks for getting it comfortable to do quickly. Like my other skills (for example C# which I have been using). I learned toward the end of the week the other interns (and the higher level guys, like the guy that says I never do anything right) took on average a few weeks. I have a personal project that I will do using Angular which was the reason I did the tender learning (and I don't need to show off anything at all to others so didn't share I was complete especially because I am supposed to do other things).<br /><br />
        <br />

        <h2>The frustrating parts.</h2>
        There are 2 frustrations that are highly annoying. I have shared one above here (the bad treatment, incorrect treatment, causing errors then blaming someone else [like him changing my code made errors]), however the other is simple to share.<br /><br />
        In the below Code Challenge I show what helps for the proof, yes I use numbers correctly. But I put it in its own category below.<br /><br />
        Also the answer is: yes. Technically I can count it as 3 for the next one being added:<br /><br />
        I can be free and share an addition to the frustration: I keep sharing "let me do what is needed so I can move on with this, doing these I do quickly and get the correct answer" and then the question gets changed so I can be fought with. Clearly I'm not wanted to keep here (by him, others treat me perfectly). That is how <big>HE</big> (who shall not be named) being kept as my "leader" and I have to listen to and do what he says frustrates me and may make me quit and recommend they go through their choice to hire him and do a doube check. He keeps fighting with people for no reason, says sometimes he can't wait to kick people out their job positions because he hates them (yes it is hateful for me to share this but he treats me the same and my response: take that away, I don't need an adult treating people like 5 year olds fighting his 4 year old - that is what he shows off for everything he does and says).<br /><br />

        <h2>The Random annoyance</h2>
        Let us use an example before I show this off... You run a loop over a bunch of values and for each value you need a random number created.<br /><br />
        I was told how I use C#'s "Random" is incorrect - so here we go (naming the code in a way that you should understand it, yes coding needs work for display - future choice):<br /><br />
        <code>
            Random rand = new Random();<br />
            int total = 0;<br />
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)<br />
            {<br />
               if (rand.Next(3) == 0) total++;<br />
            }<br />
            Console.WriteLine(total.ToString());<br />
            Console.ReadLine();<br />
        </code>
        Simple right? Yes there are additions for how I use a console app showing by default (I know there is a keypress to do it without readline but I don't need to do that). The answer you may ask? 335 I got on my first test. On average we get 33%.<br /><br />
        So let us bring up "no Ernest, that is wrong do it like this":<br /><br />
        <code>
            int total = 0;<br />
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)<br />
            {<br />
            Random rand = new Random();<br />
            if (rand.Next(3) == 0) total++;<br />
            }<br />
            Console.WriteLine(total.ToString());<br />
            Console.ReadLine();<br />
        </code>
        Like I shared when I was told my way (the first way) was incorrect - this way is NOT a randomisation. Treating random this way (with how a computer works fast) gives the same number all the time. The answer I got? 0.<br /><br />
        Well that was only the first attempt. Trying it multiple times I got the following: I got 0 twice, 1000 once, and just since I know this happens I did it tons more times and got 0 usually sometimes got 1000 and then after 5 minutes got 654. It took me 5 minutes for the running to run over a time change to change the value.<br /><br />
        Don't <big>EVER</big> try force me to change how I use Random in code where you claimed "you have no idea how it works, you don't get correct random values". You then forced it to change to the second one and said <big>MY CODE</big> was causing that problem. When I told you it was yours you just shrugged it off since you treat me just like you want to kick me out.<br /><br />
        <br />

        <h2>Code Challenge</h2>
        For the code challenge we can do something tender - a random choice from 1 to 3 is made where in [1,2,3] only one of them is correct. When you choose you get told "you can pick the one you picked or the one from the other 2 I left behind, I took away from the other 2 one that was incorrect".<br /><br />
        Simple right? You have a 33% chance to pick the first one and it is correct. Easy. Except consider the second option - one incorrect one taken away? Either the one you have or the one that you didn't pick that is available for you is the correct one. It becomes a 50% chance. I had that where I could not show it for hours - then learning the bad answers other people got that was "correct" I changed things, was told when it EVENTUALLY got checked hours later than the change I made since I wanted to kick it out (and shared that I made those changes to be mathematically incorrect) was not the correct answer.<br /><br />
        The correct answer shared with me was the answer I had before. My questioning what he said? No Ernest, No!<br /><br />
        Essentially he wanted me to share who it was I saw that was the answer for and I won't. You want it? Kick me out, fight me legally. I don't need to share he did errors tons of times clearly.<br /><br />
        So yes - I spent hours to kick out his changes and get it back before I changed it to be "correct" for how others were treated. He said to me "I will prove that I can do it and you clearly can't on Monday". Yes add hatred that you show off towards me. It was worse off with <big>YOUR CHANGES</big> and worse to fix again.<br /><br />
        What did not help fixing it was you leaving to "go home" then coming back to argue with me for an hour (since you wanted to).<br /><br />
        I can share the code shown still isn't completely correct, but the second set of values it produces (which I will share) aren't being forced to be 0 or 100 percentages.<br /><br />
        <code>
            internal string ThousandCalc()<br />
            {<br />
            Random rand = new Random();<br />
            <br />
            string answer = "";<br />
            int firstDeaths = 0;<br />
            for (int firstChoiceAllThrough = 0; firstChoiceAllThrough < TimesToDoForPercentageCheck; firstChoiceAllThrough++)<br />
            {<br />
            RandomiseTheChance();<br />
            <br />
            int choice = rand.Next(3);<br />
            ChosenTile = choice;<br />
            HisChosenTile = WorkOutWhatHePicks();<br />
            GameState = 9;<br />
            CheckWhatWasPicked(choice);<br />
            GameState = 15;<br />
            var answerwas = CheckWhatWasPicked(choice);<br />
            if (answerwas)<br />
            {<br />
            firstDeaths += 1;<br />
            }<br />
            }<br />
            <br />
            int secondDeaths = 0;<br />
            for (int secondChoiceAllThrough = 0; secondChoiceAllThrough < TimesToDoForPercentageCheck; secondChoiceAllThrough++)<br />
            {<br />
            RandomiseTheChance();<br />
            <br />
            int choice = rand.Next(3);<br />
            ChosenTile = choice;<br />
            HisChosenTile = WorkOutWhatHePicks();<br />
            GameState = 10;<br />
            CheckWhatWasPicked(choice);<br />
            GameState = 15;<br />
            int nextChoice = 1; //1 is the unpicked of the 2 choices<br />
            var answerwas = CheckWhatWasPicked(nextChoice);<br />
            if (answerwas)<br />
            {<br />
            secondDeaths += 1;<br />
            }<br />
            }<br />
            <br />
            answer += "Keep pill tests: " + TimesToDoForPercentageCheck.ToString() + ", Died: " + firstDeaths.ToString() + " times, Die Percentage: " + (100 * firstDeaths / (TimesToDoForPercentageCheck * 1.0)).ToString() + "%\n";<br />
            answer += "Change Pill Tests: " + TimesToDoForPercentageCheck.ToString() + ", Died: " + secondDeaths.ToString() + " times, Die percentage: " + (100 * secondDeaths / (TimesToDoForPercentageCheck * 1.0)).ToString() + "%";<br />
            <br />
            return answer;<br />
            }<br />
        </code>
        On average this gives me 33% which I kept getting before my code change and the second average 50% where it was. I haven't fixed all his changes (he made tons of changes - don't let him be on your team since he will blame errors on you he has shown that off tons of times) unfortunately - I took 2 hours to fix it being the 100% or 0% because of his changes...<br /><br />
        Where I am halfway through the fixing of his errors I get an average of 44% and 70%. It will be fixed by me since I need to <big>LEARN</big> how to fix others bad errors added by coding changes.<br /><br />
        I don't completely know where my game development changes were kicked out by his changes and what I want to do (and I will thankfully do) is recreate this engine line by line. I don't need proof of his errors. I am a programmer and game developer. I can hold my own hand and get correct answers.<br /><br />
        With his treatment of me - I should have "gotten" these challenges on Tuesday - yet he didn't have enough time to copy paste questions. That would be where he said later on the day if I am ready it would be checked. He isn't available all the time. If I become an intern I am going to ask if I can just be away from him and not used by him. The project I would be put on should have been learned and tested within days of getting it. It has been a week and it has been shown off that the dev enviroments and actual project is not yet possible to completely understand.<br /><br />
        
        <h2>The end summery</h2>
        So my actual question to summerise that first week only being bad with <big>ONE</big> person's treatment of things is - why do you try prove I am bad by breaking my code more <big>AND THEN</big> saying it was me? I learned on Friday a lie I was given by him was incorrect.<br /><br />
        The interns you kept saying to me casually weren't getting money - so when I learned that they <big>DO</big> (from other team members since I had not asked) I questioned you and you summerised your incorrect answer as "no Ernest I did <big>NOT</big> say that, they do earn money" - well how I treat the second week will be horrible. I will add notes saying <big>EVERY SINGLE THING</big> you say to me and do to kick my code into incorrectness.<br /><br />
        I want to <big>WORK</big> to help my recovery and I cant help my recovery by being treated horribly. With what you have shown I feel my programming level (which isn't as good as it was last year) is double yours - and my attempts to be correct for people is there where yours clearly isn't. With your addition of bad treatment for this week? I might kick myself out the job because I could even be a bad bar tender and get better treatment by people than how bad you made me feel on the first week.<br /><br />
        I know this is a typical argumentatic nature - but like I shared to others I shared this with: I don't do that since he shared if interns do that to him (which he can't wait for) he wants to kick them out. Yes I can kick myself out. I feel ok because of that so currently I might.<br /><br />
        You should try to be human and not treat people like they are excrement that didn't get flushed away by you in the toilet. Especially since I felt I needed to share this and say this because of how you should not be a high level "leader" in this working enviroment.<br /><br />
