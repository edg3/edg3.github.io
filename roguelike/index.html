    <h3>About:</h3>
    <p>Ernest Loveland began his game dev career in 2007 experimenting in high school and eventually becoming a member of the South African game development community. Over the years he has experimented with commercial game release and worked in roles related to game development ranging from quality assurance, game designer and game programmer. Over the years after developing a love for difficult games and roguelikes in particular with help of friends the design came together for a roguelike loosely based on the concepts from the MMO "Ragnarok Online".</p>
    <p>RagnaRogue/RoCD (Remnants of Chaotic Days) is a "tactical team roguelike" heavily inspired by a love for Pokemon, Ragnarok Online and various other games. The collection of (hopefully) fresh ideas, borrowing of existing good ideas and some care should hopefully give an awesome roguelike/RPG experience.</p>
    <p>The game will be set in a fantasy world where due to past clashes with the gods who are seated in Valhalla the entire world is in constant peril. The end goal will be for you to collect up a team of characters and try to ascend to Valhalla and challenge the gods to return the world to the way it was before.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> being in an alpha state many aspects of the game as it is will change rapidly over the next 3 to 6 months - this could be anything from setting and name to the base mechanics of the game to things as simple as the way the world is represented. Past releases will be available as long as it is reasonable to keep access to them open.</p>
