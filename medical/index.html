        <h1>Ernest Loveland - Medical records</h1>
        <small><i>Note: Reminder was set to remove all of this on 30 June 2018</i></small><br />
        <br />
        For the exam concessions at Rhodes university (2018) I was asked to provide my medical documentation so I felt I should make it all available.<br/>
        Shortly after I was asked to provide the full documentation it was approved, however, I still feel I should make them available for a short period.<br /><br />
        I will be making sure I do everything needed to, I will be doing everything as soon as I can for what has been shared (like I will organise the counselling psychologist meeting even if I don't need it, will see what happens after the first exam).<br />
        <br />
        <font style="color:blue">I have hilighted where I think may have whats needed to share my traumatic brain injury in blue below.</font><br />
        <br />
        I included the costs forms in-case we need reference to the medical treatment I needed (like I was on Epilizine for a long time), just in-case I miss something that is needed and isn't shared in others.<br />
        <br />
        I know a lot of these aren't needed but I just want to be careful all the documentation is available if needed.<br />
